\begin_layout Title
Spatial Pattern Optimization for Intra-Cortical Stimulation with High Density
 MEA 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The capabilities of invasive 
\emph on
in-vivo 
\emph default
neural recording-stimulating systems made of multiple contact, so called
 Multi Electrode Arrays (MEA), is improving lately, mainly because of advances
 in fabrication processes and miniaturization capabilities.
 While there are many examples of successful very high density MEA developed
 for 
\emph on
in-vitro
\emph default
 recordings (Berdondini, other ref, ecc), the challenge of 
\emph on
in-vivo 
\emph default
recordings lies in the fact that there are much stricter size and power
 consumption limitations.
 New prototypes have been developed in the last years which attempt to overcome
 this limitation and to reach 
\emph on
in-vitro
\emph default
 high density also for 
\emph on
in-vivo 
\emph default
systems.
 This challenge is well motivated: such micro system, in fact, have the
 potential of extracting information not only about some neurons like tetrodes,
 but they could record, identify, and even localize hundreds of neurons
 in the proximity of the electrodes (localizing ref).
 The problem of going in the tens of micro-scale spacing, when dealing with
 neural recording, is mainly about noise.
 The smaller the electrodes are, the higher the noise; with such a diminished
 SNR it gets more challenging to identify spike waveforms and the spike
 detection-sorting can result in accuracies.
 On the other hand, though, the higer density of electrodes assures a high
 number of simultaneous recordings, giving the possibility to reduce noise
 by applying array processing techniques (e.g.
 spatial averaging).
 The integration of these high density MEA in CMOS technology can be achieved
 through the use of Electrolyte-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect-Transistor
 (EOSFET).
 The gate of the transistor itself serves as sensor and it is coupled through
 a dielectric layer in order to increase the capacitive component.
 Purely capacitive contacts, could also be used to stimulate the tissue
 with different approaches.
 One of the latest example is given by the ENIAC chip (ref), a closed-loop
 fully encapsulated chip for neural recording and stimulation, which applies
 tri-phasic constant currents pulses by providing balanced voltage ramps.
 Another recent prototype worth mentioning was developed by (thewes ref):
 a 16 by 16 matrix of EOSFET with 15 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m pitch was fabricated on a single shank of 300 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m width.
 The system only performed recording (no stimulation) and it was tailored
 for Local Field Potentials (LFPs), but integration with stimulation could
 be possible either with a switching system and direct access to the gate
 of the EOSFETs, or with a parallel circuitry and interleaved electrodes.
 The former approach would not allow simultaneous recording and stimulation,
 but it would yield a higher resolution, whereas the latter would be capable
 of simulataneous recording and stimulation at the expense of contact density.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A system capable of both recording and stimulating neural tissue is very
 interesting especially in order to perform closed-loop experiments, in
 which stimulation is triggered from certain features extracted from recording
 the same neural sites.
 Such implants become very fascinating because they have the capability
 of inducing neuroplasticity 
\emph on
in-vivo
\emph default
, i.e.
 they can make neurons learn.
 Jackson et al.
 showed that by stimulating for 48 hours a 
\emph on
target
\emph default
 neuron in the motor cortex 5 ms after a second 
\emph on
trigger
\emph default
 neuron fired an action potential, the 
\emph on
trigger-to-target 
\emph default
connection was greatly enhanced up to 10 days after conditioning was stopped.
 Many following studies tried to use these spike-triggered stimulation to
 improve neural rehabilitation and recovery (cortico spinal fetz, nudo).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main problem of recording-stimulation systems is the asymmetry between
 the two modalities.
 While for recordings it is relatively easy to reach a single-neuron discriminat
ion by using spike sorting techniques, that allow to identify different
 neuron based on their recorded waveform features, stimulation is much more
 rough.
 Hundreds of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

A are injected (or drawn) from electrodes and they spread radially in all
 directions.
 This results in a diffuse activation of neurons surrounding the stimulation
 site.
 Rebesco et al.
 demonstrated that by applying spike-triggered stimulation in a rat somatosensor
y cortex, not only the connection between 
\emph on
trigger 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
target 
\emph default
was strengthened, but also many 
\emph on
non-target
\emph default
 connections were affected and the entire neural network of recorded neurons
 changed its behavior.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When studying neuroplasticity, it is definitely of great importance to be
 as selective as possible in order to be able to limit parasitic effect
 and to have a better controlled environment.
 Recent studies have demonstrated great promise, showing that from MEA recording
s it is possible to localize neuronal somas in the surrounding of the electrodes.
 In Ruz et al., 144 neurons were localized (soma position) 
\emph on
in-vivo 
\emph default
with a 32 electrode MEA with an area of 275 x 36 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset

(spacing 22-25 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m).
 From another recent work (ref) performed with high density (HD) MEA (17.5
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m pitch) 
\emph on
in-vitro
\emph default
, not only neurons were localized, but such a high density was also used
 to reconstruct the axonal arbors using the redundancy of recordings and
 spike-triggered average.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Certainly, 
\emph on
in-vivo 
\emph default
recordings are more noisy and less controllable, but it may be possible
 to exploit HD MEA to estimate the position of neurons surrounding the MEA
 and also to estimate the direction of propagation of the axon hillock,
 i.e.
 the axon tract more proximal to the neuronal soma.
 In this work we assume that the previous information is available and we
 exploit the same MEA to tailor stimulation spatial patterns to be as selective
 and as effective as possible.
 The goal is to show that spatial patterns can be optimize in order to depolariz
e/hyperpolarize specific identified neurons, while not activating others.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

We show that it is possible to selectively activate neurons which are as
 close as 5 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m from each other (much less than actual cortical separation), but with
 a different axon direction.
 The main limitation of this approach, though, is that in order to keep
 optimization fast and implementable online, simple models are used for
 the MEA stimulation, which introduce estimation errors, that should be
 quantified with more sophisticated models.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The computational framework for performing the simulations was completely
 developed in Python, using custom models for the MEA and LFPy (ref), based
 on Neuron (ref), for the simulation of neural activation and responses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
MEA
\series default
 was modeled as a grid (10 x 10) of monopolar current sources on a semi-infinite
 plane, with a pitch of 15 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m, resembling the prototype described in (thewes).
 The semi-infinite plane approximation os due to the fact that electrodes
 lie on a shank, facing the neural tissue only from one side.
 The maximum current deliverable from each electrode was set to 50 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

A.
 With this model, the potential at position 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{r}$
\end_inset

 is: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V(\vec{r})=\sum_{i}\frac{I_{i}}{2\pi\sigma\left|\vec{r}-\vec{r}_{i}\right|}=\sum_{i}\alpha_{i}I_{i}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline

where 
\family roman

\begin_inset Formula $\vec{r}_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{i}$
\end_inset

 are the position and current of the i-th electrode and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is the conductivity of the tissue, assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous.
 This model is clearly to simple to represent the reality of stimulating
 a tissue especially because the tissue is not homogeneous and isotropic
 as there are a moltitude of dendrites, axons, glial cells, vessels, etc.
 On the other hand, this model is very simple and linear in the currents,
 which makes it very interesting and fast for optimization problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
neurons 
\series default
were modeled in a different way for optimization and evaluation.
 Neuron cables are usually modeled with the so called cable equation, which
 describes the spatio-temporal dynamics of a linear tract of cylindric made
 of discrete compartments.
 When the length of each compartment tend to 0, the cable equation can be
 expressed in a continuous form:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda^{2}\frac{\partial^{2}V_{m}}{\partial x^{2}}+\tau_{m}\frac{\partial V_{m}}{\partial x}-V_{m}=-\lambda^{2}\frac{\partial^{2}V_{e}}{\partial x^{2}}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

in which 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{m}$
\end_inset

 are the spatial and temporal constant, respectively; 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{m}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{e}$
\end_inset

 are the membrane potential, and the external potential and 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is the axon direction.
 The right-hand side of the cable equation governs the generation of spikes
 and can be used to predict their location along the axon.
 For this reason it is referred as 
\emph on
activation function 
\emph default
(AF) (Rattay 1990).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to excite the neurons, thus, the second derivative of the potential
 along the axon direction must be higher than a certain threshold.
 For optimization of the spatial pattern a neuron is represented by a single
 segment starting from the soma location, with the direction and length
 of the axon hillock.
 Hence a 
\emph on
geometric neuron
\emph default
 consists of a 3D point (soma), an alignment (axon hillock direction), and
 a length (which was set to 15 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m).
 Moreover, since the second order derivative must be computed numerically
 along the 3D axon direction, also a number of discrete points along the
 axon is specified and it was set to 3 (which basically gives a positive
 2
\begin_inset Formula $^{nd}$
\end_inset

 derivative if the central potential (at 7.5 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m) is smaller than the edges (0 and 15 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m), and viceversa).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the optimal spatial pattern is generated, it is evaluated on more sophistic
ated neuronal models in the LFPy environment.
 From linear passive models implementing the cable equation, to multi-compartime
ntal models with more complex geometry, passing through simple linear active
 models (WORK IN PROGRESS).
 In this way we can evaluate the efficacy of the optimization and the simple
 model described above is sufficient to target and activate neurons lying
 in the surrounding of the MEA.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Optimization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The optimization framework is implemented using DEAP package (ref).
 Genetic algorithm have been selected for different reasons:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the high number of degrees of freedom (in the 10x10 configuration there
 are 100 parameters) would make other numerical optimization very time consuming
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
it can be easily customized in terms of fitness function, random generation,
 mutation operations, and constraints
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
it is relatively fast and therefore it could be suitable for an online setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Genetic algorithms perform optimization with a stochastic approach, by randomly
 sampling the solution space (in this case the 100 currents to be assigned
 to each electrode) and evaluating them with a fitness function.
 Therefore, the fitness function plays a very important role and represents
 the key to achieve a good optimization.
 Let us summarize what we want to achieve with stimulation so that it would
 be easier to understand how the fitness is built.
 First of all, we want to depolarize the target neuron(s) by applying a
 positive AF along its axon.
 It should be emphasized that the goal is not to maximize the AF as it would
 result in a diffuse and not focalized stimulation, but it is enough to
 exceed the threshold by a safety margin.
 Second, when other surrounding neurons are present, we want to find a spatial
 pattern that does not generate a spike.
 Also in this case we would like a certain margin, so we can set the AF
\emph on
 
\emph default
along surrounding axons to be lightly hyperpolarized.
 Third, we would prefer a sparse solution, for it would be easier to implement
 and it would consume less power (power efficiency is very important especially
 for implanted devices).
 This said, the fitness function have 3 objectives:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Activation of target neuron: for all points in which the AF
\emph on
 
\emph default
is evaluated, add 1 if it's above threshold, or subtract the difference
 between the AF
\emph on
 
\emph default
value and the threshold normalized over the difference between the activation
 threshold and the non activation threshold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Light hyperpolarization of surrounding neurons: same as point 1.
 but inverted (add 1 when AF
\emph on
 
\emph default
is below non activation threshold, otherwise add the normalized difference)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Solution sparsity: sum o zero-current electrodes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 3 objectives are maximized and they are given the same weight.
 The solution will then represent a trade-off among these three objectives
 .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to keep an eye on a physical implementation of the system, some
 constraints on the value of currents are added.
 In particular the currents can go from -50
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

A to +50
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

A , but the can only have 5
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

A steps; therefore currents can have 21 different values, but a negative
 current would be the opposite of the positive one, so only 10 values (excluding
 0) can be generated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Selection of the solutions to be mated was performed with a selection tournament
 approach.
 Two-point crossover was used as crossover operator and crossover was applied
 with 80% probability.
 Mutation was applied to 10% of the population and it consisted of 2 steps:
 in the first step a gaussian mutation was applied with 20% probability
 to each current value; then, in order to favor sparse solution 10% of the
 current values were randomly set to 0.
 The best solutions of each iteration were always kept in the offspring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The genetic algorithm was run for 50 generations and the population was
 made of 100 individuals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Results (preliminary)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Single Neuron
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As anticipated in the previous section, the optimization is tailored to
 deal with multiple neurons (a target and some surroundings).
 We tried to run the optimization also for a single neuron lying 10 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m away from the MEA (x = 10) and with different orientations in the plane
 parallel to the MEA (y-z plane).
 From the cable equation and the AF, the best way to stimulate an axon would
 be with a cathodic current (durand, rattay), i.e.
 a sink.
 Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 shows the potential on the yz plane at x=10
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m and it can be noticed that the spatial patterns is basically cathodic
 (blue represents a potential trough).
 Some spurious currents appear in the left and central panel, but they would
 have most probably disappear with a higher number of generations due to
 the sparsity mutation.
 It should be noticed that at this stage the algorithm does not try to focalize
 the activation as no information of surrounding neurons is provided.
 (horizontal inclination is not presented but for symmetry along y and z
 axis it should give the exact same results).

It is also interesting to look at the distribution of the second derivative,
 i.e.
 the AF, along different directions.
 Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:neurons-3 dv2"

\end_inset

 shows how the AF changes along the z, the y axis, and the target neuron
 axis (built as a weighted average between y and z components based on target
 alignment) of the second configuration.
 It can be appreciated visually how the potential is shaped so as to meet
 the optimization objectives.
 On the left panel it is clear that the AF is very high for the target neuron.
